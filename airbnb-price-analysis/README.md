1. Project Overview
   I chose this topic because Airbnb is a widely used platform, and understanding how various features influence listing prices can be valuable for both hosts and analysts.

2. Data Source
   Where did the data come from? (e.g., Inside Airbnb)

3. Objective
   Analyze the factors affecting Airbnb pricing (e.g., location, room type, number of reviews, etc.)

4. Analysis Workflow
   Overview of the steps: EDA → Data Cleaning → Feature Engineering → Modeling → Evaluation → Conclusion
