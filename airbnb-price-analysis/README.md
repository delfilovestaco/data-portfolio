1. Project Overview
   I chose this topic because Airbnb is a widely used platform, and understanding how various features influence listing prices can be valuable for both hosts and analysts.

2. Data Source
   The data used in this project was obtained from Inside Airbnb, which provides publicly available data on Airbnb listings in various cities.

3. Objective
   The goal of this analysis is to identify the key factors that affect Airbnb listing prices, such as location, type of accommodation, number of reviews, and other relevant features.

4. Analysis Workflow
   The project will follow these steps:
   1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution and relationships
   2. Data cleaning and preprocessing to prepare the dataset for modeling
   3. Feature engineering to create meaningful variables
   4. Model building to predict listing prices
   5. Model evaluation to assess accuracy
   6. Drawing conclusions and recommendations based on findings
